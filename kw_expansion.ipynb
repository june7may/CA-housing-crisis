It is an iterative approach, meaning that you start with a list of keywords, and expand it, run it again etc. until you saturate the list. The approach also emphasises that you should read some of the text that you label, in order to ensure correct labelling.\n","\n","\n","This exercise is a python translation of Gregory Eady's R exercise, heavily inspired by the replication material found here: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FMJDCD."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ecdf8452","metadata":{"id":"ecdf8452"},"source":["If interested, you can also see Greg's walk-through of the R version of this code in his video here:\n","https://gregoryeady.com/SocialMediaDataCourse/readings/Keywords/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1ae27c29","metadata":{"id":"1ae27c29"},"source":["### Read in required packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":142,"id":"bb6fd13b","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2486,"status":"ok","timestamp":1713432358791,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Vigild","userId":"08967762330835575953"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"bb6fd13b"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","#import pyreadr #package to allow us to read in .rds data files (native R datafile)\n","from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer\n","import re\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","from collections import OrderedDict\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","from collections import namedtuple\n","import numpy as np\n","from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer\n","from nltk.tokenize import WhitespaceTokenizer\n","import nltk\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","import random\n","from math import lgamma\n","from sklearn import linear_model\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import datetime"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9c383674","metadata":{"id":"9c383674"},"source":["# 1.

ottawa considers the potential tourism and affordability impacts of the proposed tax changes in her fall fiscal update finance minister chrystia freeland announced plans to go after income tax deductions from noncompliant owners of shortterm rental properties in an effort to expand canadas longterm rental supply starting jan one specifically the federal government said it will be denying income tax deductions to noncompliant shortterm rentals such as airbnb and vrbo properties in provinces and municipalities where restrictions are in place such as toronto montreal and vancouver alongside this the liberals earmarked fifty million over three years to help support municipal enforcement of their shortterm rental restrictions however the required legislative changes to implement this move were left out of a sizeable bill presented to parliament in late with federal officials stating plans to consult on the tax measures first before passing reforms that would be in place in time for the tax filing season right before the holidays finance canada announced it had launched consultations on draft income tax act amendments which included a proposed formula for how the government will be calculating the noncompliant amount for the taxation year this assessment will factor in the total expenses incurred the number of days the residential property whether a house apartment condo cottage trailer or houseboat was noncompliant and the number of days the property was a shortterm rental meaning it was offered for rent for a period of less than ninety days airbnbs canadian policy lead nathan rotman said the shortstay giant is always willing to work with lawmakers to address community concerns but does not think that homesharing regulations are the solution to canadas housing crisis the reality is the majority of airbnb hosts in canada share one home to supplement their income and listings represent less than one percent of the countrys housing stock rotman said in a statement to ctvnews ca many canadians earn extra income through home sharing to make ends meet at a time of increasing inflation interest rates and cost of living airbnb has taken the position that with its listings representing less than one per cent of canadian dwellings reducing the number of their rentals wont make a significant dent in canadas housing stock and rather will target hosts for making income to help them continue to afford their homes further the company pointed to a conference board of canada report based on airbnb booking data from highuse or fulltime airbnb listings between and across neighbourhoods in canada that found that the level of airbnb activity has not generated any meaningful increase to the cost of rent across the country vrbo parent company expedia group said that while it supports efforts to drive a high rate of compliance with provincial and municipal shortterm rental regulations effective shortterm rental policies are only achieved through open dialogue and collaboration shortterm rentals have played a critical role in canadas tourist economy and its communities for generations and travellers will continue to seek them as an option for vacations and family gatherings said hunter doubt manager of expedia groups government affairs for canada in a statement to ctvnews ca the company looks forward to reviewing the legislation in greater detail and strongly encourages the federal government to consider the feedback of travel and tourism experts like expedia group as it moves forward doubt added at the time the federal shortterm rental crackdown was revealed the federation of canadian municipalities said the incoming regulations for vacation stays was a step towards improving housing affordability but represents a small piece of the issue the government has previously signalled optimism that this move taken as part of a wider package of housing policy measures will be successful in unlocking more housing supply in short order housing minister sean fraser has pointed to regulations imposed in new york as an example where thousands of housing units were opened up for longterm rental a little more than a month later though the measures taken in that instance are more comparable to municipal initiatives undertaken across canada than the federal governments approach of denying tax advantages for example in new york city hosts need to register with the mayors special enforcement office if they intend to rent out their space for fewer than thirty days in toronto any operator of a unit rented out for less than twentyeight consecutive days has to register with the city in both instances theres a registration fee and a series of requirements that need to be met to qualify my view in a housing crisis is that if a municipality determines that you have an opportunity to put homes on the market for families to rent for the long term then you should do that instead of making them available for a few days at a time fraser told reporters on nov twentyeight those interested in the shortterm rental consultations can share their feedback on what the government is proposing by sending an email to consultationlegislationfin gcca until feb\n","Article: the city of ottawa wants to see affordable housing and a two fivehectare park with an outdoor skating rink and pickleball

Identifying Significant Terms: Log likelihood helps identify terms that are significantly associated with a particular category or class of documents. This can be useful in tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or document classification, where certain terms may be more indicative of a particular category.\n","\n","2. Feature Selection: By ranking terms based on their log likelihood values, you can prioritize which terms to include or exclude in further analysis or modeling. This helps in feature selection, where you aim to identify the most informative features for your predictive model.\n","\n","3. Interpretation: Log likelihood provides a quantitative measure of the strength of association between terms and categories. This allows for better interpretation of results and helps in understanding which terms are driving differences between categories.\n","\n","4. Hypothesis Testing: Log likelihood can be used for hypothesis testing to determine whether the observed frequencies of terms in different categories are significantly different from what would be expected by chance. This helps in assessing the statistical significance of observed patterns in text data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":188,"id":"158bef3c","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":451,"status":"ok","timestamp":1713432968786,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel

Proportions:**\n","- target_freq and target_num_docs: Frequency of the token and the number of documents classified as \"target\" that contain the token.\n","- target_num_docs_prop: Proportion of target documents containing the token.\n","- not_target_freq and not_target_num_docs: Frequency of the token and the number of documents classified as \"not target\" that contain the token.\n","- not_target_num_docs_prop: Proportion of not target documents containing the token.\n","- ref_freq, ref_num_docs, ref_num_docs_prop: These might represent a reference category or overall frequency and proportions of the token, giving additional context.\n","\n","\n","**Interpreting target_larger:**\n","This column seems to be a boolean indicating whether the proportion of target documents containing the token is larger than that of not target documents.\n","- Log-Likelihood (llik) Explanation:\n","The llik value quantifies how likely the observed distribution of a token across \"target\" and \"not target\" categories is, under the assumed statistical model.\n","- Negative Values: The llik values are negative, which is typical for log-likelihoods because they are often calculating log probabilities, which are less than 1 (thus log of a fraction is negative).\n","- Magnitude of llik: Larger absolute values (more negative) suggest lower likelihoods, indicating that the observed distribution of the token is less probable under the assumed conditions of the statistical model. This might be used to identify tokens that have significantly different distributions between target and non-target groups, potentially indicating key words that distinguish between these groups.\n","\n","**Interpretation of llik Values:**\n","When comparing rows, a more negative llik value indicates a greater divergence from what the model predicts if there were no difference in the token's distribution between target and not target documents. In other words, tokens with highly negative llik values are more distinctive in differentiating between the two categories.\n","Tokens like \"respons\", \"pro\", \"case\", and \"inform\" with highly negative llik values suggest they are particularly predictive or indicative of the difference between the two categories.\n","\n","**Usage:**\n","These values can be crucial in machine learning (for feature selection), statistical analysis to test hypotheses about word usage in different categories, or refining algorithms that categorize documents based on content.\n","In summary, llik helps you gauge the statistical strength and uniqueness of tokens in separating or characterizing documents into categories. Tokens with notably lower (more negative) llik values are particularly effective or important in distinguishing between target and non-target documents, suggesting their strong association with one category over the other."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":199,"id":"1a73a083","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":833},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":17,"status":"ok","timestamp":1713432973292,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel
